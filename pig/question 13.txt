-- problem 13 - List Employee names starting with ‘S’ and having five characters

-- load employee file
employee = LOAD '/user/pig/employee.txt' USING PigStorage(',') as (empno:int, ename:chararray, job:chararray, mgr:int, hiredate:chararray, sal:float, comm:float, deptno:int);

-- get all records
all_recs = foreach employee generate empno,ename, job,mgr,hiredate, sal, comm,deptno;

-- filter records according to the criteria

-- order records
rec_ordr = order rec_fltr by sal;

-- display records to screen
