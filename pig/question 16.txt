-- problem 16 - explain operator is used to display the logical, physical, and MapReduce execution plans of a relation.

-- load employee file
employee = LOAD '/user/pig/employee.txt' USING PigStorage(',') as (empno:int, ename:chararray, job:chararray, mgr:int, hiredate:chararray, sal:float, comm:float, deptno:int);

rec_fltr = filter all_recs by ( job != 'MANAGER' AND job != 'PRESIDENT') ;

dump rec_ordr;

-- explain how the data will be retrieved in terms on MapReduce operations
